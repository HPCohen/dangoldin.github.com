Apple’s Touch ID is great but one thing it doesn’t handle very well is dealing with moisture. Even if my hands are a little bit sweaty or not fully dry it’s difficult to unlock the phone. Yet as soon as they’re dry the phone immediately unlocks. What’s surprising is that this hasn’t been solved yet. I’m not familiar with the hardware behind Touch ID but the fact that a few unsuccessful wet versions of my thumb are followed by a successful thumbprint should be enough to build out a valid profile for the wet version. I’m not entirely sure this approach would work since there may a hardware limitation when it comes to moisture but Apple strives to deliver the best experience and this would be an easy win. I expect we’ll see our products get better and better at understanding our patterns until they become eerily predictive.
