I’m a huge Twitter fan so it’s especially frustrating when I encounter issues. The latest one was when I clicked into a moment highlighting the Euro Cup only to discover the following message “This content is not available in your country.” I understand that in today’s digital content world there’s always a chance for some content to be unavailable but there’s no reason it should be included in Twitter’s flagship product that’s supposed to attract and engage new users. The fact that it’s manually curated makes it even worse - how could this have slipped through? One explanation is that the curator was not based in the US. The other is that the video was available initially but was pulled later on. In both cases Twitter should have had the appropriate safeguards to identify this was happening and amend the moment. This feels sloppy and I can’t stand to see it in a product I love using.
