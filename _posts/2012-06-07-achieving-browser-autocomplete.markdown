<p>Over the past few days, I’ve been thinking about habits. How do they form? How do they change? And the selfish one - how can you build a product that is habit forming? My cofunder sent me a great Nir &amp; Far <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html">blog post</a> that goes into detail about generating desire which is a great read to anyone building a consumer product.<br/><br/>Along these lines, I decided to be a bit introspective and see which products and sites are a part of my habit. A simple way was to type each letter of the alphabet into the Google Chrome address bar and see what site autocompletes. Here goes:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>analytics.google.com</li>

<li>bankofamerica.com</li>

<li>cad-comic.com/cad</li>

<li>docs.google.com</li>

<li>eventbrite.com</li>

<li>facebook.com</li>

<li>glos.si</li>

<li>heroku.com</li>

<li>instapaper.com</li>

<li>joinblended.com</li>

<li>klout.com</li>

<li>linkedin.com</li>

<li>maps.google.com</li>

<li>news.ycombinator.com</li>

<li>optimum.com</li>

<li>plus.google.com</li>

<li>questionablecontent.net</li>

<li>reader.google.com</li>

<li>startupmullings.com</li>

<li>twitter.com</li>

<li>udacity.com</li>

<li>voice.google.com</li>

<li>wixlounge.com</li>

<li>xkcd.com</li>

<li>youtube.com</li>

<li>zerply.com</li>

</ul>

<p>After excluding my sites (glos.si and startupmullings.com), we can organize them into the following categories:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>Entertainment (the comic sites - xkcd, QC, CAD; Youtube; Google Reader)</li>

<li>Social Networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, Twitter)</li>

<li>Utilities (Google analytics/docs/voice, Bank of America, Instapaper, Eventbrite, Optimum, Heroku)</li>

<li>The rare letters (Zerply, Udacity, Wix Lounge). I’d like to include Klout on this list rather than admit to browsing it but I don’t know if that will be believable.</li>

</ul>

<p><span>Every consumer site should strive to get to browser autocomplete status for some users rather than being semi-popular to more users. Being useful to a few passionate users and growing with their help is a much better approach than trying to immediately appeal to the mass market.</span><br/><br/>And although this exercise may be embarrassing, I’d love to see what others have as their 26 sites.</p>
