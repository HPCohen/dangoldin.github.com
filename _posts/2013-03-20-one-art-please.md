At the beginning of 2013, I set a <a href="http://dangoldin.com/2013/01/02/2013-goals/" target="_blank">goal</a> to do something with my hands to contrast with the constant life in front of the screen. I finally finished my first “art” project this past weekend and documented the result. I had a stash of old, torn jeans that were just taking up space and instead of throwing them out I decided to have some fun. Here’s the process and end result.

<ul class="thumbnails">
  <li class="span8">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}1-art.jpg" alt="Silhouette of the NYC skyline">
      <p>1. Find a silhouette of the NYC skyline</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="span8">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}2-art.jpg" alt="Arrangement of jean pieces">
      <p>2. Replicate the silhouette by cutting pieces out of old jeans and arranging them on a piece of cardboard wrapped in another shade of jeans.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="span8">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}3-art.jpg" alt="Fabric glue">
      <p>3. Use some fabric glue to attach the pieces to the canvas</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="span8">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img src="{{ IMG_PATH }}4-art.jpg" alt="Resulting art">
      <p>4. The result - now all it needs is a frame</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
