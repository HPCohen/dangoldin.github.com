The more I use Snapchat the more potential I see. The way the product has evolved reminds me of Facebook’s trajectory. Facebook started simply as a profile page for Ivy League college students but with strong execution and some tough product decisions has grown into the current Behemoth. Snapchat is on a similar path - the initial version was an ephemeral photo sharing app but recent updates have been both frequent and impactful.

</div>

Earlier today I was messing around and spotted a movie trailer ad for Swiss Army Man that was followed by a swipe up option to buy tickets that felt completely native to Snapchat. I didn’t have to click to go to another app and it felt natural to swipe and get to the next step. And this is a simple case of buying movie tickets. I can easily imagine this flow expanding to other experiences that couple a powerful ad with an immediate transaction. This reminds me of WeChat - the powerhouse app in China that’s an unholy mix of a [social network, a payments platform, and an app ecosystem](http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/). Many are searching for the WeChat equivalent outside of China but seem to be looking for something that looks and feels like WeChat. Snapchat doesn’t look or feel like WeChat yet has the potential to eclipse it. WeChat is built on top of text and a third party app ecosystem while Snapchat is almost entirely visual and provides a controlled experience.

This is huge. Interacting with Snapchat is a joy, whether it’s taking photos, playing with the filters, checking our your friends’ stories, or watching the Discover videos and I suspect it’s due to the wonderful job they did with the interactions. They’re not immediately intuitive but once discovered are intuitive and consistent that provide a wide range of options. Want to go next? Just tap. Want to engage more? Swipe up. Want to go back? Swipe down. This is incredibly powerful. By learning these shortcuts Snapchat is able to offer a variety of adventures that we can easily engage with without requiring any extra screen real estate. This allows every experience Snapchat offers to take up the full screen. This keeps us in the moment and makes it easy for us to get hooked and keep going.

Snapchat is already taking the first steps to becoming a platform by enabling external groups to build on top of Snapchat. The obvious case are the content product in the Discover section but a better example is the way they’re approaching geofilters. [Geofilters](https://snapchat.com/geofilters) are created offline, are uploaded to the Snapchat site, and after approval become accessible in the app. This will become Snapchat’s formula - build out a new in-app experience and then follow it up with tools for outsiders to craft their own. Two quick ideas:
Product shots: Similar to the movie trailer ad I encountered today it could easily have been a video of a product being used followed by an option to buy.
Multi-touch: The location of the tap can matter and can open up a variety of experiences within a given story. Imagine tapping a player to see some stats or even a “choose your own” adventure flow. The monetization here is clear as well - tapping on LeBron’s sneakers or jersey will open up the Snapchat-integrated Nike store.

I’m also extremely bullish on Snapchat being able to effectively monetize. The advertising industry can be broken down into two big types - brand advertising and direct response. Brand advertising is the typical TV ad that’s focused on building awareness and selling a story and lifestyle. Direct response, on the other hand, is about getting the customer to convert by taking a desired action with every dollar spent needing to provide a measurable return. Think of Google Adwords - if you search Google for a book, click the sponsored Amazon link, and then buy it, Amazon will will know how much you paid for the book as well as how much they paid Google for the click. Using this data they can then optimize their various campaigns to maximize purchases while maintaining a profit. Snapchat may be able to do both. It’s the perfect platform for high quality brand videos that take up the entire screen but can easily translate into transactions - very similar to my trailer/ticket experience earlier today. Maybe they will even achieve the holy grail of attributing purchases to brand advertising.

Snapchat may seem tiny compared to Facebook but it’s important to realize that major shifts in the tech world have never been direct. New platforms start at the fringes but keep growing until they supplant the incumbents. Google superseded Microsoft by becoming the gateway to the web. Facebook is supplanting Google by letting users go straight to Facebook on any platform without touching the open web. How would Snapchat unseat Facebook? I don’t know but I’m sure Facebook is watching.
