Although it's wonderful to think that we will be able to colonize other worlds when we grow too numerous or run out of resources, it may not happen. It seems that given the level of current weapons and state of the world we will more likely try to conquer each other than try to conquer space.

In order to go into space we would need to have an advanced level of technology which could only be created through innovation. I am just worried that technological advances tend to be used as weapons first, and as humanity benefiting objects second. This may have been fine with the technology of old but we are approaching the level where a weapon can wipe us out. The non warlike use may not come to fruition if there will be no one left to develop it.

I just hope we realize that the next global war may be the last war we fight and that we need to control our competitive spirit. A quote that comes to mind is Albert Einstein: "I know not with what weapons World War Three will be fought, but World War Four will be fought with sticks and stones." I'd just like to add that I'm not so sure there will even be a World War Four.
