Now that fantasy football season is over for me and I have no risk of angering the fantasy football gods I can complain about an interface decision in the Yahoo Fantasy Football Android app. Every once in a while the app will sign me out, which I suspect is a security feature, but I can log back in without having to re-enter a password. The only effect this “feature” has is getting me annoyed. The app has clean and simple visual design but that shouldn’t be prioritized over actual usability. Hopping between apps is such a common task that developers should strive to make it as painless as possible. This may involve changing the views around to make them more light weight or figuring out a way to simulate behavior without having to show a loading screen but it definitely makes the app feel snappier and more responsive.
